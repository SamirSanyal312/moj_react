Master of Jokes is a Flask-based web application that lets users share, view, and rate jokes in a unique exchange system inspired by the concept:  "Have a penny, leave a penny. Need a penny, take a penny."  Users earn joke credits by contributing jokes and spend them to view jokes submitted by others.
